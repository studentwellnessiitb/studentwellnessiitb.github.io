        <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">Greetings, Resilient Learners,</p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            Thank you so much for taking the time to participate in our recent mental health survey! We truly appreciate your openness and engagement. If you find it a little overwhelming to interpret your results, we are here to break things down for you and offer better clarity.
        </p>

            <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Depression</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Depression is more than just feeling sad—it’s more like a lingering heaviness that can affect your mood, energy levels, and even your interest in things you once enjoyed. If your results showed signs of depression, remember—you’re not alone, and it's okay to feel this way. Reaching out for help can make a world of difference.

            <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Anxiety</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Anxiety is something we all experience from time to time, but when it becomes constant or overwhelming, it can make daily life feel challenging. If your results indicated higher anxiety levels, don’t worry; there are plenty of ways to manage it and regain your balance.

            <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Grit</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Grit is all about your ability to stick with your long-term goals, even when things get tough. If your results showed high grit, that’s a strength you can lean on to push through challenges. If you scored lower, don’t sweat it—grit is something you can build over time by focusing on perseverance, embracing challenges, and developing a growth mindset.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                (For context, we compared your grit score to the US national averages from the groundbreaking research of Prof. Angela Duckworth, who was the first to study and define grit as a key factor in achieving success. You can read more about grit in her book, <em>Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance</em>.)

            <h2 style="color: #0056b3;">Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities, intelligence, and talents can be developed over time with effort, practice, and learning. People with a growth mindset see challenges as opportunities to grow rather than as roadblocks.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                On the other hand, a fixed mindset is the belief that abilities are set in stone—you either have them or you don’t. People with a fixed mindset might avoid challenges because they fear failure will reveal a lack of ability.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Your survey results may have reflected where you tend to fall on this spectrum. If your results showed more of a fixed mindset, don’t worry—mindsets can shift! By recognizing where you feel "stuck," you can start focusing on growth by embracing challenges and viewing setbacks as part of the learning process.
